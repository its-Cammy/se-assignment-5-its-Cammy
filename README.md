      Continue (`F5`): Continue executing until the next breakpoint or program completion.
      Step Over (`F10`): Execute the current line and move to the next one (skipping function calls).
      Step Into (`F11`): Move to the next line and step into function calls to debug their execution.
      Step Out (`Shift+F11`): Finish execution of the current function and return to the calling function.
      Restart (`Ctrl+Shift+F5`): Stop the current debug session and restart from the beginning.
      Stop (`Shift+F5`): Terminate the current debug session.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code

 Variable Inspection: Hover over variables to see their current values or add them to the Watch panel for continuous monitoring.
  
 Call Stack: View the sequence of function calls that led to the current execution point.
  
 Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that trigger only when specific conditions are met (e.g., `i == 10`).
  
 Debug Console: Interact with your running program via the debug console to execute commands and evaluate expressions.
  
 Multi-Session Debugging: Run and debug multiple configurations simultaneously, useful for microservices or client-server applications.

 Integrated Terminal: Access an integrated terminal within VS Code to run commands and debug interactively.

 Customizable Launch Configurations: Modify launch configurations (`launch.json`) to adjust debugging behavior and environment settings.

 Example Scenario

Suppose you are debugging a Node.js application that calculates factorial numbers:

1. Set a breakpoint at the start of the function calculating the factorial.
2. Start debugging (`F5`).
3. The debugger stops at your breakpoint.
4. Use debugging controls to step through the function, inspecting variables to ensure calculations are correct.

    Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (Git icon).

3. Initialize Git Repository:
    Click on the `Initialize Repository` button (if no repository is detected) or open a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``) and run:
     ```
     git init
     ```
    This initializes a Git repository in your project folder.

 Making Commits

1. Stage Changes:
    In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changes (untracked files or modified files).
    Click on the `+` icon next to a file to stage it for the commit. Alternatively, you can stage all changes using the `+` icon at the top.

2. Write a Commit Message:
    Enter a commit message that describes the changes you are committing.
    Press `Ctrl+Enter` or click the checkmark ✓ button to commit the changes.

 Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. Create a Repository on GitHub (if not already done):
    Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository with a name and optional description.

2. Add Remote Repository:
    In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for `Git: Add Remote`.
    Enter the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).

3. Push Commits to GitHub:
    After committing your changes locally, click on the ellipsis `...` in the Source Control view or open the Command Palette and select `Git: Push`.
    Choose the remote repository (GitHub) where you want to push your changes.
    If prompted, authenticate with your GitHub credentials.

4. Verify on GitHub:
    Visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your changes have been successfully pushed.

 Additional Git Operations

 Branching and Merging:
   Use the Source Control view or the Command Palette (`Git: Create Branch`, `Git: Merge Branch`) to create and merge branches.

 Pulling Changes:
   Use the Source Control view or the Command Palette (`Git: Pull`) to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.

 Viewing Commit History:
